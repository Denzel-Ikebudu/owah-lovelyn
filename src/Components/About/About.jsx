                    <p>
                    I didn’t just stumble into marketing , I built my career on the simple truth 
                    that the right words and strategy can change everything for a business. <br /><br />
                    I began as a copywriter in the health and wellness space, where I learned how 
                    to turn complex ideas into simple, persuasive messages that move people to act. 
                    That foundation opened the door to digital marketing and strategy, where for the 
                    past 5+ years I’ve helped brands craft campaigns that don’t just get attention .. 
                    they get results. <br /><br />
                    I’ve worked with companies like Zonic, Onesmos, Voulay, Simplifyvas , wellnessunityhub ,
                    rune and a host of others across the UK, US, Asia, the Philippines, and India. <br /><br />
                    What I bring isn’t just marketing , it’s growth. Whether it’s writing high-converting 
                    copy, designing a funnel that captures and converts, or building a strategy that 
                    scales, I focus on one thing: helping businesses sell more and grow faster. <br /><br />
                    Now, I’m expanding into business development taking everything I know about communication, 
                    marketing, and strategy, and turning it into partnerships and systems that unlock 
                    new opportunities for growth. <br /><br />
                    If you’re looking for someone who can combine persuasion, strategy, and execution
                     to help your business grow, let’s talk.</p>
